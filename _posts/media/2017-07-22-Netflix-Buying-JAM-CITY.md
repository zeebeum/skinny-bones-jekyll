## Netflix announced the acquisition of the Jam City. As of July 25th, Jam City will no longer exist and it will be renamed as G-STREAM.
Friends,

I’ve got great news.

We are happy to announce Jam City is now becoming a part of Netflix. Jam City’s cofounder and CEO, Chris, and its 510 employees will now be joining Netflix’s kick-ass 275 designers, graphic artists, developers and marketing ninjas. We’re thrilled to begin working together as part of one team. Last July, we received a $130 million investment from South Korea-based Netmarble Games, and we promised that as the mobile gaming industry consolidated we weren’t going to stand by and watch. The mobile gaming business is a good place to be these days. This year, revenues are expected to surpass those from the PC and console gaming industries for the first time ever. 

We expect to expend our business and earn more than half a billion dollars within the year, and we think we can even do better in the near future. Embracing a company that gets this trend will help us do it. 

Best,
